# GOOSE-GOD
For Solar.

On September 15th, Nights promised to make a bot that only responded to honks. That night, HONKERS, or what is now known as GOOSE GOD, was born. The project was left in a dusty python folder that didn't even bother hiding its bot token --  all the way until January 2021 -- when Nights decided that instead of studying for her two finals the day after, to instead begin anew with the bot. Within two days it was a piece of shit that was able to respond to honks.

Ok, enough poeticism. It's a fucking goose bot. What more do I have to say? *grumbles*
